## 🧐 Contributions, Pull Requests and Issues

are very welcomed because I know jack shit about web development. The source code contains some unused CSS and bad practices, which should be cleaned up slowly one by one, but it works for now and looks okay so I don't care. Enchantments are also welcomed!

## 🚀 Plans and future

Better documentation for the `README.md` file, better experience for smaller/higher resolutions and aspect ratios, more basic locales (e.g. Es, Fr, Nl...).
